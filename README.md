# Crop-node-dataset



## Overview

This study focuses on the internode length of crops. Internode length is the distance between two consecutive nodes along the same direction on the trunk. We aimed to develop a faster and more accurate deep neural network to detect nodes under natural scenarios and estimate the internode length. When the internode length is found to be abnormal, our proposed method can make corresponding judgments and take corresponding measures to provide accurate decision making for automation management.



## Dataset

The datasets used in this study included chilies, tomatoes, and eggplants. The chilies and tomatoes were grown in a natural environment, the eggplants were cultivated in a greenhouse environment, and all plants were in a growing state. 

The final collected images of chili, eggplant, and tomato plants comprised 50, 180, and 350 images, respectively. The total number of pictures of the three types of crops was 580, including 4455 nodes, with an average of 6 nodes per image.
